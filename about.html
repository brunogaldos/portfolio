            <h1>Hello there! üëã</h1>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm a Peruvian robotic engineer specializing in AI and robotic systems.  
                For my master‚Äôs thesis, I developed a real-time navigation controller for mobile robots, integrating 
                motion capture systems, LIDAR, SLAM, C++, and ROS to enhance mapping accuracy and efficiency in industrial applications.  
                Currently, I work as an assistant researcher at the WZL Institute, where I design advanced algorithms for robotic perception 
                and picking tasks using a UR10 manipulator and an Intel depth camera.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Beyond robotics, I have deep expertise in artificial intelligence. I develop and train Large Language Models (LLMs) 
                with 45 billion parameters for AI agent integration, leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.  
                During my internship at Siemens, I gained hands-on experience deploying and optimizing machine learning techniques for 
                AGV localization using SIMATIC RTLS signals based on UWD technology. These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation 
                in AI, robotics, and software engineering, with proficiency in Python, SQL, C++, and extensive experience with Linux, ROS, 
                Docker, SolidWorks, Git, and microcontrollers.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I‚Äôm also passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship. I have contributed to several tech development projects, winning 
                national competitions for tech startups and hackathons. Here are some highlights:

                I thrive in dynamic, forward-thinking environments where creativity and problem-solving drive meaningful change.  
                My goal is to be part of a team that not only pioneers innovation but also shapes the future‚Äîone that challenges 
                me to grow while making a tangible impact in AI and robotics.
